# Define the variables
principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # Time period in years

# Calculate simple interest using the formula
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
